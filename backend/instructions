# then time for the migrations

# make a copy .env.example and rename it to .env
# make sure you have a mysql db with the corresponding name inside your new .env file
# or uncomment the sqlite db config that wil work on the fly

# next, run migrations, seed your db with the sample model factories and then artisan serve the app
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve
